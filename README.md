#README
This repo was restarted in early 2023.
I used to have linux and windws configs which had symbolic links to my files.
I decided to update my vim and bashrc files along with a new tracking style. Having my $HOME be my repo directory, with a .gitignore file matching everything and adding files on a one-by-one basis
Got the idea from Drew DeVault's [BlogPost] (https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html)
